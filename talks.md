Here is a list of talks that I've given at conferences and research seminars:

* Aug 2024: _Distribution of Ray Class Groups of Random Number Fields_, [Y-RANT](https://y-rant.github.io/), Oxford
* Nov 2023: _Arithmetic Statistics and the Cohen--Lenstra Principle_, [GEARS](https://sites.google.com/view/gears-seminar/home), Edinburgh
* Nov 2023: _Cohen--Lenstra Heuristics for Ray Class Groups_, [Junior Number Theory Seminar](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/juniornumbertheory/23-24/), University of Warwick
* Nov 2023: _Cohen--Lenstra Heuristics for Ray Class Groups_, Glasgow internal number theory seminar, 3 talks
* Aug 2022: _Cohen--Lenstra Heuristics: Distribution of Class Groups of Random Number Fields_, [Y-RANT](https://heilbronn.ac.uk/2022/04/21/y-rant-2022/), Glasgow, [Slides](/docs/Talk_Y_RANT.pdf)
* Mar 2021: _Jordan Blocks of Unipotent Elements in Spin Groups_, [Number Theory Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/tinkovamagdalena/teaching/number-theory-seminar), Charles University Prague (online), [Slides](/docs/Talk_Prague.pdf)


Moreover, I have given several talks at the [Glasgow Algebra Pre-Seminar (GAPS)](https://sites.google.com/view/glasgowalgebrapreseminar/home), which takes place before the Glasgow [Algebra and Number Theory Seminar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=4) and aims at providing other PhD students with the necessary background to follow the main seminar talk:

* Jan 2023: _Modular Representation Theory_, ahead of the main talk _Endomorphisms of Gelfand--Graev representations_ by [Jack Shotton](https://jackgshotton.webspace.durham.ac.uk/)
* Nov 2022: _Serre's Modularity Conjecture_, ahead of the main talk _Modularity in the partial weight one case_ by [Hanneke Wiersema](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~hw600/)
* Feb 2022: _The Absolute Galois Group of Q, p-adic Galois Representations, and Modular Forms_, ahead of the main talk _p-adic variation of Galois representations and modular forms_ by [Rebecca Bellovin](https://rmbellovin.github.io/)
* Dec 2021: _Arithmetic Statistics and Elliptic Curves_, ahead of the main talk _Average Ranks of Elliptic Curves after p-Extension_ by [Ross Paterson](https://ramifiedprime.github.io/)


<!--- I enjoy giving talks to non-experts... and promote mathematics... might put PG seminar talks here --->
