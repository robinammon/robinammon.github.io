Hi! I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Glasgow, working with [Alex Bartel](https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~abartel/).
I did my undergrad at TU Kaiserslautern, where my Master's Thesis was supervised by [Gunter Malle](https://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~malle/en/).


You can contact me under r.ammon.1 [at] research.gla.ac.uk.
